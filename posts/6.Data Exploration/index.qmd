Firstly, we use R to perform a simple visual analysis on the soccer dataset

Distribution of Match Performance (Histogram):
•	The histogram shows the frequency distribution of 'Match Performance' scores.
•	The distribution appears to be normal with the highest frequency centered around a score of 8.
•	Conclusion: The majority of players have a Match Performance score around 8, indicating a tendency towards higher performance levels in this dataset.

Match Performance vs Salary (Scatter Plot):
•	This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between 'Salary' and 'Match Performance'.
•	There is no clear pattern or trend that indicates a relationship between the salary and performance.
•	Conclusion: Based on this scatter plot, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between a player's salary and their match performance.

Match Performance by Position (Boxplot):
•	The boxplot compares 'Match Performance' across different playing positions.
•	The medians are quite similar across positions, suggesting that the position might not be a strong predictor of Match Performance.
•	Conclusion: All positions show a similar range of Match Performance, indicating that the position alone is not a primary determinant of performance in a match.

Correlation Matrix (GGally ggpairs plot):
•	The matrix includes scatter plots for pairwise relationships and histograms for the distribution of individual variables.
•	'Training Level' and 'National Team Performance' show a strong positive correlation with 'Match Performance', as indicated by the correlation coefficient (Corr: 0.859 and 0.962 respectively) and the density of points along a line in the scatter plot.
•	Conclusion: Both 'Training Level' and 'National Team Performance' are likely important factors influencing 'Match Performance'.

Correlation Heatmap:
•	This heatmap shows the correlation coefficients between different variables.
•	Strong red color indicates a strong positive correlation, as observed between 'Match Performance' and 'National Team Performance', as well as 'Match Performance' and 'Training Level'.
•	Conclusion: There is a strong positive correlation between 'Match Performance' and both 'National Team Performance' and 'Training Level', reinforcing the findings from the ggpairs plot.
In summary, the visualizations suggest that while salary does not have a strong relationship with match performance, factors such as training level and national team performance may be significant predictors of how well a player performs in a match. There is no strong evidence to suggest that a player’s position is a decisive factor for their match performance within this dataset.
