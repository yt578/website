My Topic: On and off the pitch for soccer players

Modern soccer has become one of the current mainstream sports all over the world, and with the advancement of time and technology, many of the problems regarding soccer can be solved with more advanced technology rather than simple manpower. As a club manager, not only do we need to analyze the performance of footballers on the pitch, but many issues off the pitch are gradually coming to the forefront of people's attention, so I will list the following ten issues and seek to analyze them through data.

My questions:

1.Can the training data of players be truly reflected on the field?

2.Injuries can be painful for a player. After recovery, will the player's performance on the field be affected?

3.Even in the same club, there are differences in the salaries of players, and how much does this affect their performance?

4.What is the reason why many players are different between the national team and the club?

5.Sometimes, the weather on the court can be very bad, how much does it affect the game?

6.Different players have different foot habits. When they play football in different positions, will their foot habits and reverse foot ability become key factors

7.Yellow and red cards are not uncommon on the field. Will there be some correlation between their numbers in different countries and levels of leagues?

8.Many teams use different formations, will the use of this formation affect the results?

9.The dietary management of a club is very important, and how much does it affect the physical indicators of players?

10.The influence of a club is reflected in the number of season tickets sold. What factors affect it?
