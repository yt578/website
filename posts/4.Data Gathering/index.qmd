In order to obtain a large number of player data and their field performance data, I downloaded the most used European soccer database dataset from kaggle.

As for the data on team formation and game results, I need a unilateral reference, so I obtained the data from fbref, a well-known data website, so that I can only use one team as a reference in a game to avoid the repeated use of one data
